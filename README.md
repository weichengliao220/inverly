Hello, my name is Brian Liao. Welcome to my GitHub!

I recently graduated from Le Wagon Tokyo's Web Development Coding Bootcamp (Batch #1808) and am currently seeking a junior web developer position.

Inverly is an ETF simulation app that enables users to forecast the future performance of ETFs based on historical data.

This [pitch](https://www.canva.com/design/DAGVVFMkoGo/XiKzKPERQbEndmqZeBik2Q/edit?utm_content=DAGVVFMkoGo&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=sharebutton) was originally proposed by me and was one of the six selected for the final project. Together with 3 other students (Roman Gautrand, Esteban Lopez and Adam Brunson), we dedicated 2 weeks to building it and presented it on [Demo Day](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOaKm9em24c&t=1770s).

Inverly is currently hosted on Heroku and available at: https://www.inverly.biz

For a quick demonstration purpose, you can log in to the app using the following credentials or sign up for a new account:
